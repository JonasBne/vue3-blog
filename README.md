# Vue Weather App

## About this repository

Vue Weather App is a demo application I've created to explore the features and core concepts of Vue 3. The primary objective of this project is to gain familiarity with Vue 3. Since this demo is intended only for learning purposes I've taken certain shortcuts and some details were not implemented to the same level of depth as I would do in a production-ready application (e.g. incomplete types, the use of any keywords, hard coded strings, design,...). The detail page for weather forecast only holds some data about the current weather. The forecast data is not implemented.
